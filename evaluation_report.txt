Summary Observations:
- Latency: 
  * KB-only queries: ~0.08–0.13s
  * CSV lookups: ~0.18–0.24s
  * Web search (simulated): ~0.27s
- Quality:
  * Strong when queries matched KB or CSV (Q1, Q2, Q4–Q6).
  * Weak on queries outside KB scope (Q3, Q9, Q10).
  * Web search simulated — functional, but limited for real-world.

Takeaways:
- Pipeline correctly decides when to use KB vs. tools.
- Latency per query is low (<0.5s).
- Future Work:
  * Integrate real web search API.
  * Expand KB coverage.
  * Handle multi-intent queries.
